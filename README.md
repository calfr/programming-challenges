# Programming Challenges
This repository is to store general programming challenge solutions. These are as an demonstration of my own generalised skills.
The sources of each challenge vary - I aim to describe the challenge through the path of each file, and through readme files where appropriate.
## Note
I aim to respect the intent of authors when it comes to publishing challenge solutions. Typically, only solutions to problems from concluded contests or where permission is stated by the author will be shared here. I do use this repository in locally storing 
If you are the author of a challenge, find this repository and would like for a solution to be removed, please let me know.
